Introduction
------------

The goal of this package is, to detect file renames based on the file contents, similar to the way `git` does it.
Files and contents are provided as javascript object, so this module should not need to access file system and
may even work in a browser.


Example
-------

```js
var detect = require("detect-rename.js");

console.log(detect({
   "abc": "Lorem ipsum sit desc",
   "cde": "Lorem ipsum sit incro",
   "qwertz": "poiu",
   "cdeg": "Lorem ipsum sit incroa"
},{
   "abcd": "Lorem ipsum sit desca",
   "cdef": "Lorem ipsum sit incro",
   "qwertz": "poiu"
}));
```

Output:
```js
{
cde: { to: 'cdef', sim: 1 },
abc: { to: 'abcd', sim: 0.9629629629629629 }
}
```
